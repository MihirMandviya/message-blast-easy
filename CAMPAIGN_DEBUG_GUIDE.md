# Campaign Debug Guide

## Issues and Solutions

### 1. CORS Error: "Access to fetch at 'https://theultimate.io/WAApi/send' has been blocked by CORS policy"

**Problem**: The browser is trying to make a direct API call to the WhatsApp API from the frontend, which is blocked by CORS.

**Solution**: âœ… **FIXED** - The API calls now go through the Supabase Edge Function which handles CORS properly.

**What was changed**:
- Updated the "Test API" button to use the edge function instead of direct API calls
- All campaign sending now goes through the edge function (`/functions/v1/send-whatsapp-message`)

### 2. "No contacts found in the selected group"

**Problem**: Campaigns are being created but fail to send because the selected group has no contacts.

**Root Cause**: The `contact_groups` junction table is empty - contacts haven't been added to groups.

**Solutions**:

#### Option A: Add Contacts to Groups
1. Go to **Contact Management** page
2. Create contacts or import them
3. Go to **Groups** section
4. Add contacts to the group you want to use for campaigns

#### Option B: Use a Group with Existing Contacts
1. Check which groups have contacts (the contact count is shown in the dropdown)
2. Select a group that shows a contact count > 0

#### Option C: Create a New Group with Contacts
1. Create a new group in Contact Management
2. Add contacts to this group
3. Use this group for your campaign

### 3. Enhanced Validation and User Experience

**New Features Added**:

1. **Visual Warning**: Groups with 0 contacts now show a warning message
2. **Validation Check**: Campaign creation is blocked if the selected group has no contacts
3. **Enhanced Debug**: The debug button now shows detailed information about contacts and groups
4. **Better Error Messages**: Clear explanations of what went wrong and how to fix it

## How to Test

## Database Structure

The campaign system uses these tables:
- `campaigns` - Stores campaign information
- `groups` - Contact lists/segments
- `contacts` - Individual contact information
- `contact_groups` - Junction table linking contacts to groups
- `templates` - Message templates
- `messages` - Individual message records

## Common Issues and Fixes

### Issue: "Contact groups found: 0"
**Fix**: Add contacts to the group using Contact Management

### Issue: "No contacts found in the selected group"
**Fix**: Select a different group or add contacts to the current group

### Issue: "Authentication Error"
**Fix**: Log out and log back in to refresh your session

### Issue: "Template not found"
**Fix**: Ensure the template exists and belongs to your account

## Next Steps

1. **Add Contacts**: Use the Contact Management page to add contacts to your groups
2. **Test API**: Use the "Test API" button to verify the WhatsApp API connection
3. **Create Campaign**: Once you have contacts in a group, create your campaign
