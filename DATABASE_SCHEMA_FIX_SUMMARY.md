# Database Schema Fix Summary

## Issue Description
The campaigns, templates, and media tables had incorrect user_id references. They were referencing the `client_users` table instead of the `clients` table. Additionally, there was no way to track which member (client_user) added each record.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added `added_by` Field
Added a new `added_by` column to the following tables:
- `campaigns`
- `templates` 
- `media`

This field stores the UUID of the `client_user` who added the record.

### 2. Fixed `user_id` References
Updated the `user_id` field in the following tables to reference the `clients` table instead of `client_users`:
- `campaigns`
- `templates`
- `media`

### 3. Data Migration
- Migrated existing data to preserve the relationship between records and the client_user who created them
- Updated all existing `user_id` values to reference the correct `clients.id` instead of `client_users.id`
- Set the `added_by` field to the original `user_id` value (which was the client_user who created the record)

### 4. Foreign Key Constraints
- Dropped old foreign key constraints that referenced `client_users.id`
- Added new foreign key constraints that reference `clients.id` for the `user_id` field
- Added foreign key constraints for the `added_by` field to reference `client_users.id`

## Final Schema

### Campaigns Table
```sql
user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id)        -- References the client/organization
added_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES client_users(id)  -- References the member who added
client_id UUID REFERENCES client_users(id)          -- Legacy field (can be removed later)
```

### Templates Table
```sql
user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id)        -- References the client/organization
added_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES client_users(id)  -- References the member who added
client_id UUID REFERENCES client_users(id)          -- Legacy field (can be removed later)
```

### Media Table
```sql
user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES clients(id)        -- References the client/organization
added_by UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES client_users(id)  -- References the member who added
client_id UUID REFERENCES client_users(id)          -- Legacy field (can be removed later)
```

## Benefits
1. **Correct Data Relationships**: `user_id` now correctly represents the client/organization that owns the record
2. **Audit Trail**: `added_by` field provides a clear audit trail of which member created each record
3. **Data Integrity**: Proper foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing `client_id` field is preserved for any legacy code

## Migration Steps Applied
1. Added `added_by` columns to all three tables
2. Updated existing records to set `added_by` to the original `user_id` value
3. Dropped old foreign key constraints
4. Updated `user_id` values to reference `clients.id` instead of `client_users.id`
5. Added new foreign key constraints
6. Made `added_by` columns NOT NULL

## Verification
- All existing data was successfully migrated
- Foreign key constraints are properly established
- Sample data verification shows correct relationships:
  - `user_id` now references valid `clients.id` values
  - `added_by` references valid `client_users.id` values
  - Data integrity is maintained

## Next Steps
1. Update application code to use the new schema
2. Consider removing the legacy `client_id` field if no longer needed
3. Update any queries or API endpoints that reference these tables
4. Update TypeScript types to reflect the new schema
