### 2. Updated App.tsx
- **Removed MemberAuthProvider**: Eliminated the MemberAuthProvider wrapper from the app structure
- **Cleaned up imports**: Removed the import for MemberAuthProvider

## Files Modified

### `src/pages/Auth.tsx`

- Removed `LoginType` type definition
- Removed `loginType` state and `switchLoginType` function
- Simplified `handleSubmit` function to only handle client login
- Removed login type selector cards

### `src/App.tsx`
- Removed `MemberAuthProvider` import

- Simplified the provider structure

## Current State

The authentication page now provides a clean, simplified interface with:
- **Single login option**: Only client login is available
- **Clear UI**: Removed confusing multiple login type selection
- **Streamlined experience**: Users can directly enter their User ID and password
- **Admin access**: Admin login is still available via the top-right corner button

## Benefits

1. **Simplified User Experience**: Users no longer need to choose between different login types
2. **Reduced Complexity**: Eliminated unnecessary conditional logic and state management
3. **Cleaner Code**: Removed unused imports and components
4. **Focused Functionality**: The app now focuses on client authentication as the primary method

## Test Account Information

The auth page still displays the test client account information:
- **User ID**: nandlalwa
- **Password**: Nandlal@12

## Admin Access

Admin login functionality remains unchanged and is accessible via:
- The "Admin Login" button in the top-right corner of the auth page
- Direct navigation to `/admin-auth` route

## Next Steps

1. **Remove unused files**: Consider removing `src/hooks/useMemberAuth.tsx` if no longer needed
2. **Update documentation**: Update any documentation that references member login
3. **Test functionality**: Verify that client login still works correctly
4. **Clean up any remaining references**: Check for any other member-related code that might need cleanup
