# Client Login Update Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Authentication Logic (`src/hooks/useClientAuth.tsx`)
- **Changed authentication source**: Now uses `client_users` table instead of `clients` table
- **Updated login credentials**: Now uses `email` and `mem_password` instead of `user_id` and `password`
- **Updated ClientUser interface**: Modified to match the `client_users` table structure
- **Updated error messages**: Changed from "Invalid User ID or password" to "Invalid email or password"

### 2. Updated Auth Page (`src/pages/Auth.tsx`)
- **Changed input field**: Updated from "User ID" to "Email"
- **Updated input type**: Changed from `type="text"` to `type="email"`
- **Updated placeholder text**: Changed from "Enter your User ID" to "Enter your email"
- **Updated description**: Changed from "Sign in with your User ID and password" to "Sign in with your email and password"
- **Updated test account info**: Changed test credentials to use email format

## Database Table Structure

### `client_users` Table Fields Used
- `id` (UUID) - Primary key
- `email` (text) - User's email address
- `mem_password` (text) - User's password
- `business_name` (text) - Business name
- `phone_number` (text) - Phone number
- `whatsapp_api_key` (text, nullable) - WhatsApp API key
- `whatsapp_number` (text, nullable) - WhatsApp business number
- `user_id` (varchar, nullable) - Legacy user ID field
- `is_active` (boolean) - Account status
- `subscription_plan` (text) - Subscription plan
- `subscription_expires_at` (timestamp, nullable) - Subscription expiry
- `created_at` (timestamp) - Account creation date
- `updated_at` (timestamp) - Last update date

## Authentication Flow

### Before (Old System)
1. User enters User ID and password
2. System queries `clients` table with `user_id` and `password`
3. If match found, user is authenticated

### After (New System)
1. User enters email and password
2. System queries `client_users` table with `email` and `mem_password`
3. If match found, user is authenticated

## Test Account Information

The auth page now displays updated test credentials:
- **Email**: nandlal@example.com
- **Password**: password_123

## Compatibility

### Existing Components
Most existing components should continue to work as they use:
- `client.id` - Available in both old and new structure
- `client.email` - Available in both old and new structure
- `client.business_name` - Available in both old and new structure
- `client.whatsapp_api_key` - Available in both old and new structure
- `client.whatsapp_number` - Available in both old and new structure
- `client.user_id` - Available in both old and new structure (nullable in new)

### Components That May Need Updates
Some components might need minor updates if they rely on:
- Field name differences between `clients` and `client_users` tables
- Specific field requirements that might be nullable in the new structure

## Benefits

1. **Consistent with Database Schema**: Now uses the correct table structure
2. **Better User Experience**: Email is more user-friendly than User ID
3. **Improved Security**: Uses dedicated member password field
4. **Future-Proof**: Aligns with the intended user management system

## Next Steps

1. **Test Authentication**: Verify that login works with the new credentials
2. **Test Existing Features**: Ensure all components that use client data still work
3. **Update Documentation**: Update any documentation that references the old authentication method
4. **Monitor for Issues**: Watch for any components that might break due to field changes
5. **Consider Cleanup**: Remove any unused code related to the old authentication method

## Migration Notes

- Existing sessions will be invalidated as the data structure has changed
- Users will need to log in again with their email and mem_password
- The system maintains backward compatibility for most client data fields
- Admin authentication remains unchanged and separate from client authentication
